## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   `git`

### Recommended Installation (Linux)

For Linux users, the recommended way to install HeraCLIs is by using the provided script. This will create a command-line launcher and a desktop entry in your application menu.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heraclis.git
    cd heraclis
    ```

2.  Run the installation script:
    ```bash
    ./install_desktop.sh
    ```
    This script will create a launcher at `~/.local/bin/hw` and a desktop file. You can then run the application by typing `hw` in your terminal or by finding "HeraCLIs" in your application menu.

### Manual Installation (All Platforms)

You can also install the application manually. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/heraclis.git
    cd heraclis
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment. Using `uv` (if you have it) is fast:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv # or: uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install . # or: uv pip install -e .
    ```

4.  Now you can run the application:
    ```bash
    python3 hw.py
    ```
    To make it easier to run, you can create an alias or a symlink.

## Usage

To start the interactive menu, simply run:

```bash
hw
```

This will present you with a menu to log workouts, view stats, manage exercises, and more.
